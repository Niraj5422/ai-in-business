#### Fairness: Types of Bias

- **Reporting Bias**

- **Automation Bias**

**Automation Bias** is a tendency to favor results generated by automated systems over those generated by non-automated systems, irrespective of the error rates of each.

**The above video is demonstrating optical flow detection within the bounding box images as you can see. The detected points are filtered over a threshold which emits data to be sent through an analysis pipeline. The Analysed data is possibly used to determine the statistical parameters of the video.**

**So why does Automation Bias exist? Automation Bias exists when a piece of software with single original model can be used to determine the statistical properties which helps in optimization of characteristics of the video.**

- **Selection Bias**
    - Coverage Bias
    - Non-response Bias
    - Sampling Bias

- **Group Attribution Bias**
    - In-group Bias
    - Out-group Homogeneity Bias

- **Implicit Bias**
    - Confirmation Bias
    - Experimenter's Bias
