## Agile Manifesto

## Value Statements

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

- The idea is not to throw away the processes and tools that work for you but to o=focus on people and interactions over any rigid plan or process.

- Tools that increase people interactions and promote technical agility should be encouraged.

### Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation

- The focus is to move away from the extensive documentation needs with traditional plan-driven development approach.

- We don't need to abstain from all documentation, but need to create only minimal just-in-time documentation.

### Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation

- Understand your customer's behaviors, problems, goals and motivations

- Collaborate and build with your customer

- Seek early feedback from your customers

(Since the effort is minimal, agile leaders should not take important decisions until last responsible moment - LRM. )

### Responding to Change over Following a Plan

- Coined to move away from the traditional plan-driven development approach

- The idea is to adapt to changing busines needs rather than following an upfront project plan. 

- Being agile does not mean that you don't plan. Instead, you may have a working plan that is reviewed and updated periodically. 

## PRINCIPLE 2

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processses harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. 

## PRINCIPLE 3

- Deliver working softwre frequently from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. 

- Build an architectural runway and increase devops maturity
- Teams can deliver frequently
- Should focus on built in quality with each iteration

## PRINCIPLE 4

- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project

- How can agile leader help promote collaborarion
- If team members are geographically dispersed then they will have to fund the team members for travel
- Leaders should ensure access to remote collaboration tool in case of pandemic
- Environment of openness with collaboration at equivalent feel

## PRINCIPLE 5

- Build projects and motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 

- Team needs arch runway, env that promotes technical agility
- Release on demand
- Deploys new functionality in production
- Give support and take bold decisions
- Open environment and seek help from each other without any fear of judgement
- Deliver a quality product, assign tasks to themselves
- Meet definition of done
- Providing support and trusting a motivating team

## PRINCIPLE 6

- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation

- face to face conversation

## PRINCIPLE 7

- Working software (must be potentially shippable) is the primary measure of progress
- Can go live whenever desired by the customer or the product owner

- No of hours worked
- no of work items completed
- planned vs actual effort has the same importance

- Productivity or Velocity metrics

## PRINCIPLE 8

- Agile processes promote sustainable development. the sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 

- Sustainable pace

## PRINCIPLE 9

- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility

- Need to continuously seek technical excellence
- Setting up pipeline
- Intentional architecture and emerging design

## PRINCIPLE 10

- Simplicity: the art of maximising the amount of work not done - is essential

## PRINCIPLE 11

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams.

## PRINCIPLE 12

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. 

- Inspect and Adapt ceremony at end of each iteration
