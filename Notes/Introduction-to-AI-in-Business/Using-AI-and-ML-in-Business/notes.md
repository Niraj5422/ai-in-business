## Machine Learning Pipeline

- Data Ingestion
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Model Training                        # Model Selection
- Testing & Validation                  # Model Selection
- Deployment

## AI Approach

### Start with Business problem and not Data

- Busines Problem
    - Definition, value, stakeholders, priority, investment
- Data
    - Right data to solve the business problem
    - Availability
    - Privenance
    - Security
    - Coverage
    - Augmentation
    - Annotation
- Model Building
    - Feature Extraction
    - Hypetrparameters
    - Tuning
    - Selection
    - Benchmarking
- Deploy & Measure
    - Business value measurement
    - AB Testing
    - versioning
    - Business Process Integration
- Active Learning & Tuning
    - Bias mitigation
    - Ground Truth & Success Monitoring
    - Version Control

## Project Statement

- Improve conversion and sales as per the example
- Clear distinction of data that is required
- Data specifying similarity of images

### Summarised into

- What problem are we trying to solve?
- How does AI add value?
- What data do we nned?

#### Best Bytes

- Scoping of the Problem, such as the work context diagram and Use case Modeling
- How do we measure success?

## Example

- When search result had a product image which was shown by iteself that had white background that converted more than other images
- This is directly related to what is shown on the search results.

## Using AI in Buisness

- Deploy for targeted use cases [Gartner]

Reason: 5G edge use cases and 5D deployment to several purpose driven solutions

- Business problem before data [PWC]
[https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/artificial-intelligence-predictions/big-data-roi.html](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/artificial-intelligence-predictions/big-data-roi.html)

[https://www.fieldservicenews.com/blog/before-data-analytics-think-problem-to-solve](https://www.fieldservicenews.com/blog/before-data-analytics-think-problem-to-solve)

Reason: The use cases deal with historical data and is predominantly static which makes us address the problem first from a selling perspective rather than use data in the first go. Easy things first, devising a USP, we may be speculative and we do not have the evidence and reasoning to address the problem first using data so that requires an investigation.

- Success depends on the data [IBM_THINK]

[https://mindmajix.com/bpm-tools](https://mindmajix.com/bpm-tools)

Reason: A BPM is associated with data intensive processes. Management of outcome rather than tasks is the key. Data management and maintenance of data are key aspects that enable success.
