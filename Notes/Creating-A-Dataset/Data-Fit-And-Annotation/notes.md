## Answering Questions with Data

### Improve Search results

- ML relies on relevant and large enough data source
- Return relevant results
- Tailored to individual preferences
- Intuitively start thinking about what you need to solve the tasks

### Building a Dataset

- Identifying data fit with dataset
- determining use cases (is dataset complete)
- Annotation of dataset

How model performs depends heavily on data you use

- Data Size
- Pattern Detection
- Data Fit / Goodness of Fit 
    - F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
- Data Collection
- Data Relevance

## Data Completeness

- What is the problem you are trying to solve and how does it benefit your end users?
- What data will help you solve that problem?
    - Collect data and observe relationships; patterns and similarities among the data
    - Identify potential anomalies or missing data
- Conduct research and get the best data to serve your use case

## Data Annotation

- They explain about Appen Software as a service 
- Platform
- Job Creation Page
    - Common labelling jobs to explore and create
